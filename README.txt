This game is in a Game-Jam theme that Meta.AI suggested to me.
"No-Images Allowed": Develop a game using only CSS and JavaScript-generated graphics.

Meta.AI created an idea and started writing the code for me.
I asked: "Create a game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, made for mobile devices (no keyboard needed), and for portrait mode. The game can be in any genre or theme, but the game cannot use any image files at all. Develop the game using only CSS and JavaScript-generated graphics."

Meta.AI generated HTML, CSS, and JS code, and I noticed it used keyboard controls, so I asked it for some modifications.
Meta.AI also gave this game description:
Here's a simple game I came up with, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is called "Circle Frenzy" and it's a fast-paced endless runner game where you control a circle that must avoid other circles.
Game Description:
Control the blue circle with your finger to avoid the red circles. Each red circle you avoid earns you a point. The game speeds up as you progress.

To enhance gameplay, we can add the following features:
1. Increase Difficulty: To increase the difficulty level as the player progresses, we can increase the enemy speed and spawn rate.
2. Power-ups: To introduce power-ups, we can create special circles that grant temporary invincibility or increased scoring.
3. Sound Effects: To enhance the gaming experience, we can add sound effects for collisions, power-ups, and game over.
4. Leaderboard: To store and display player scores, we can use local storage or a backend database.
By incorporating these features, you can create a more engaging and challenging game.
